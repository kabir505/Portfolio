## Sustainability Score: 86/100

### Line 3
- **Current structure:** Membership Test on names
- **Usage context:** membership_test
- **Suggestion:** Use a set for membership testing.
- **Explanation:** Sets offer O(1) lookup time compared to O(n) for lists.
- **Impact:** Can reduce lookup time and CPU cycles significantly, improving sustainability.

```python
data = { ... }  # Use a set instead of a list
if item in data:
    print("Found")
```

### Line 9
- **Current structure:** Manual Dict Construction
- **Usage context:** manual_dict_loop
- **Suggestion:** Use dict(zip(...)) or a dictionary comprehension.
- **Explanation:** More efficient and idiomatic than building dicts via loops.
- **Impact:** Reduces line count and avoids repeated dictionary insertions.

```python
# No fix snippet available for this suggestion.
```

### Line 9
- **Current structure:** Dictionary
- **Usage context:** manual_counter
- **Suggestion:** Use collections.Counter instead of manual dictionary counting.
- **Explanation:** Cleaner, more efficient counting with optimised memory handling.
- **Impact:** Reduces repeated memory operations and redundant instructions.

```python
from collections import Counter
counts = Counter()
counts.update(your_data_here)
```

### Line 13
- **Current structure:** List
- **Usage context:** append_or_pop
- **Suggestion:** Consider using collections.deque for queue operations.
- **Explanation:** Deques are optimised for appending and popping from both ends.
- **Impact:** Reduces unnecessary re-indexing in lists, saving computational effort.

```python
from collections import deque
queue = deque()
queue.append("item")
queue.popleft()
```

### Line 14
- **Current structure:** List
- **Usage context:** append_or_pop
- **Suggestion:** Consider using collections.deque for queue operations.
- **Explanation:** Deques are optimised for appending and popping from both ends.
- **Impact:** Reduces unnecessary re-indexing in lists, saving computational effort.

```python
from collections import deque
queue = deque()
queue.append("item")
queue.popleft()
```
