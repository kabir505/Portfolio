## Sustainability Score: 88/100

### Line 3
- **Current structure:** Membership Test on names
- **Usage context:** membership_test
- **Suggestion:** Use a set for membership testing.
- **Explanation:** Sets offer O(1) lookup time compared to O(n) for lists.
- **Impact:** Can reduce lookup time and CPU cycles significantly, improving sustainability.

### Line 9
- **Current structure:** Dictionary
- **Usage context:** manual_counter
- **Suggestion:** Use collections.Counter instead of manual dictionary counting.
- **Explanation:** Cleaner, more efficient counting with optimised memory handling.
- **Impact:** Reduces repeated memory operations and redundant instructions.

### Line 13
- **Current structure:** List
- **Usage context:** append_or_pop
- **Suggestion:** Consider using collections.deque for queue operations.
- **Explanation:** Deques are optimised for appending and popping from both ends.
- **Impact:** Reduces unnecessary re-indexing in lists, saving computational effort.
